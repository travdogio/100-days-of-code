### R1D1 
Day 1: October 14th, 2020 - Wednesday

Today's Progress: Learned some SQL from Angela Yu. Did my first INNER JOIN.

Thoughts: Been getting up early to learn instead of late at night. I like it. Very eager to implement databases so I can move forward on the app.

Today's Progress: Refactor personal project and implement mongodb. 

Thoughts: It is very fun to start seeing the fruits of my labor. It's taken some time to get to this level of proficiency but it is starting to become quite rewarding.
